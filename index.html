<p style=" float:right";>1. PREPARE THE DOUGH
In a large bowl, mix flour, yeast and sugar. Pour in water little by little while stirring with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork).
Then knead with your hand until a smooth, elastic dough forms (see note 3). Cover the bowl with a wet kitchen towel.
Leave to rise in a warm place until double in size. It will take between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours depending on the room temperature.
MIX THE FILLING
Put all the ingredients for the filling (except for water/stock) into a large bowl.
Swirl constantly in the same direction while gradually adding water/stock spoon by spoon into the mixture.
</p>
 
 
<p style="float: right"; >2. SHAPE THE BUNS
Knead the dough on a floured work surface until it goes back to its original size.
Divide it into 20 equal portions. Roll each piece into a disk-like wrapper.
Hold the wrapper in the palm of one hand. Place some filling in the middle. Use the other hand to fold the edge anticlockwise by pinching with thumb and index finger until the bun is completely sealed (please refer to the images above).
Leave to rest for 15 minutes before frying.
FRY THE BUNS
Heat up oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Place in the buns (see note 4 & 5).
When the bottom part becomes golden brown, pour in water then cover with a lid.
Uncover when the water evaporates completely. Sprinkle sesame seeds and spring onion over.
Cook another 30 seconds or so to crisp up.
